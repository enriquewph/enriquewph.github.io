Hello, I'm an Electronics Engineering student from Argentina. Currently on my 5th year of studies, I'm really passionate about electronics, programming, and technology in general. It's really hard to select my topics of interest, as I'm always looking for new things to learn and experiment with. I'm always looking for new projects to work on, and I'm always looking for new things to learn such as:
- **Motorcycles**
  - Owner of a 92' Honda CB250 Nighthawk
- **Firmware development**
  - ESP32
  - STM32
  - AVR
  - PIC
- **Software development**
  - Docker
  - Python
  - C/C++
- **3D printing / CAD design**
- **PCB Design**
    - KiCad
    - Altium Designer
- **Networking**
- **Home automation**

You'll find in this blog a collection of my projects, tutorials, and thoughts. I hope you find them useful, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me, or leave a comment in the posts.

You will also find almost all my reports developed during my engineering studies. Have in mind that all the reports are in Spanish, as they were developed for my university courses, and all were co-authored with my classmates. Some things may be outdated, some others might be wrong, but I hope you find them useful.

On this year 2024, I'll be working on an R&D project for the development of "LORAION" satellite (aboard a different project [IONSAT](https://centrespatial-polytechnique.fr/ionsat/)) in the National Commission of Space Activities (CONAE) in Argentina. I'll be working on the development of the satellite in general, and the ground station software. I'm really excited about this project, and I hope to share some of the things I learn during this project in this blog.
